# Roll Call Recall

## Brief

At the beginning of each new semester or school year, teachers are faced with the challenge of remembering names for a large number of new students. Design an experience to help an educator match faces to names, with the goal of shortening the time needed to reach complete un-aided accuracy.

# Idea

Student face / name flashcard cross-platform application that a teacher can use to train their recognition of current students.
